(exclude AI from title?)

(include CV in title?)

keywords:
AI, data visualization, residual plot, visual inference, hypothesis testing, computer vision

# Overview of the thesis

1. background and motivation
- the role of visual diagnostics in modelling
- a brief introduction to visual inference
- limitation of lineup protocol
2. research questions
-  a. study the use of visual inference in regression diagnostics with a comparison to conventional test
-  b. build a computer vision system to evaluate residual plot
-  c. make the system available to the public
3. summarise the work in the first year
- an experiment to compare visual test with conventional test 
- a prototype model for lineup evaluation
- points out the limitation of the work
4. summarise the work in the second year
- refine and reconduct the experiment
5. main findings to date
- findings from the first year
- findings from the second year
