	abstract = {We propose to furnish visual statistical methods with an inferential framework and protocol, modelled on confirmatory statistical testing. In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ‘discoveries’ is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the ‘lineup’ popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the ‘Rorschach’ inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students’ statistical thinking.},

	abstract = {Graphical inference, a process refined by Buja et al., can be a useful tool for geographers as it provides a visual and spatial method to test null hypotheses. The core idea is to generate sample datasets from a null hypothesis to visually compare with the actual dataset. The comparison is performed from a line-up of graphs where a single graph of the actual data is hidden among multiple graphs of sample data. If the real data is discernible, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Here, we illustrate the utility of graphical inference using examples from climatology, biogeography, and health geography. The examples include inferences about location of the mean, change across space and time, and clustering. We show that graphical inference is a useful technique to answer a broad range of common questions in geographical datasets. This approach is needed to avoid the common pitfalls of “straw man” hypotheses and “p-hacking” as datasets become increasingly larger and more complex.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01131},
	abstract = {Forensic examination of evidence like firearms and toolmarks, traditionally involves a visual and therefore subjective assessment of similarity of two questioned items. Statistical models are used to overcome this subjectivity and allow specification of error rates. These models are generally quite complex and produce abstract results at different levels of the analysis. Presenting such metrics and complicated results to examiners is challenging, as examiners generally do not have substantial statistical training to accurately interpret results. This creates distrust in statistical modelling and lowers the rate of acceptance of more objective measures that the discipline at large is striving for. We present an inferential framework for assessing the model and its output. The framework is designed to calibrate trust in forensic experts by bridging the gap between domain specific knowledge and predictive model results, allowing forensic examiners to validate the claims of the predictive model while critically assessing results.},
