#### **Pooling layers** apply non-linear down-sampling on the feature maps. This helps reducing the number of parameters in the neural network so that the problem of overfiting can be controlled. 

#### One of the most popular pooling operations is **max pooling**. It divides the feature map into several rectangle regions and takes the maximum to form a new feature map.

# Simulation Setup - Cubic Model

#### We simulated data from two linear regression model with **non-linearity** and **heteroskedasticity** issues

#### The first model is a **cubic model** which can be expressed by: `$$\boldsymbol{Y}= 1 + (2-c)\boldsymbol{X} + c\boldsymbol{Z} + a[(2-c)\boldsymbol{X}]^2+a(c\boldsymbol{Z})^2+b[(2-c)\boldsymbol{X}]^3+b(c\boldsymbol{Z})^3+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon},$$` where `\(c \in (0,2)\)`, `\(a \in (-3,3)\)`, `\(b \in (-3,3)\)`, `\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\overset{iid}{\sim} N(\boldsymbol{0},\sigma^2\boldsymbol{I})\)`, `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)`, `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{Z}\)` are `\(n\times1\)` matrices.

.pull-left[
#### `\(X_i\)`, `\(i=1,...,n\)` follows one of the four distributions:
- `\(N(0, 0.09)\)`
- `\(U(-1, 1)\)`
- `\(Lognormal(0,0.36)/3 - 1\)`
- `\(-Lognormal(0,0.36)/3 + 1\)`

#### Most the realizations will fall between `\(-1\)` and `\(1\)`.
]

.pull-right[
#### `\(Z_i\)`, `\(i=1,...,n\)` follows one of the two distributions:
- `\(U(-1, 1)\)`
- Discrete uniform distribution with `\(z_n\)` outcomes ranged from `\(-1\)` to `\(1\)`

#### `\(z_n\)` is sampled from `\(\{z_n: 9&lt;z_n&lt;21 \text{ and } z_n \in \mathbb{Z} \}\)`.
]




&lt;!-- #### The distribution of `\(Z_i\)`, `\(i=1,...,n\)`, has `\(50\)`% chance to be a uniform distribution ranged from `\(-1\)` to `\(1\)`, and `\(50\)`% chance to be a discrete uniform distribution with `\(z_n\)` outcomes simulated from a uniform distribution ranged from `\(-1\)` to `\(1\)`. `\(z_n\)` itself is a discrete uniform distribution with outcomes `\(\{x: 9&lt;x&lt;21 \text{ and } x \in \mathbb{Z} \}\)`, which defines the number of possible values `\(Z_i\)` could take. --&gt;

# Simulation Setup - Cubic Model

#### The simulated data is fitted by OLS with equation: `$$\boldsymbol{Y}= \beta_0 + \beta_1\boldsymbol{X} + \beta_2\boldsymbol{Z} +\boldsymbol{u},$$` where `\(\boldsymbol{u} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2_u\boldsymbol{I})\)`.

#### Let `\(\boldsymbol{X}_a=[\boldsymbol{1},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Z}]\)` denotes the set of regressors in matrix form. Then, the **residuals** obtained from the null model are `$$\boldsymbol{e} \sim N(\boldsymbol{R}_a\boldsymbol{X}_b\boldsymbol{\beta}_b, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{R}_a),$$` where `\(\boldsymbol{R}_a=\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{X}_a(\boldsymbol{X}_a'\boldsymbol{X}_a)^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}_a'\)`, `\(\boldsymbol{X}_b=[\boldsymbol{X}^2,\boldsymbol{Z}^2,\boldsymbol{X}^3,\boldsymbol{Z}^3]\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}_b=(a(2-c)^2,ac^2,b(2-c)^3,bc^3)'\)`.

#### The **effect size** is derived as: `$$ES=n^{-1}||\sigma^{-1}\boldsymbol{R}_a^{-\frac{1}{2}}\boldsymbol{R}_a\boldsymbol{X}_b\boldsymbol{\beta}_b||^2=n^{-1}\sigma^{-2}||\boldsymbol{R}_a^{\frac{1}{2}}\boldsymbol{X}_b\boldsymbol{\beta}_b||^2\approx n^{-1}\sigma^{-2}||diag(\boldsymbol{R}_a)^{\frac{1}{2}}\boldsymbol{X}_b\boldsymbol{\beta}_b||^2,$$` where `\(diag(\boldsymbol{R}_a)\)` is the diagonal matrix constructed from the diagonal elements of `\(\boldsymbol{R}_a\)`.

# Simulation Setup - Heteroskedasticity Model

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

#### The second model is a heteroskedasticy model which can be expressed by: `$$Y_i = 1 + X_i + \varepsilon_i, ~i = 1,...,n,$$` where `\(a \in \{-1,0,1\}\)`, `\(b\in (0,32)\)` and `\(\varepsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0,1+b(2-|a|)(X_i-a)^2)\)`.

#### `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` could be one of the five distributions mentioned above - normal distribution, uniform distribution, adjusted log-normal distribution, adjusted negative log-normal distribution and discrete uniform distribution.

# Simulation Setup - Heteroskedasticity Model

#### The simulated data is fitted by OLS with equation: `$$\boldsymbol{Y}= \beta_0 + \beta_1\boldsymbol{X} +\boldsymbol{u},$$` where `\(\boldsymbol{u} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2_u\boldsymbol{I})\)`.

#### Let `\(\boldsymbol{X}_a=[\boldsymbol{1},\boldsymbol{X}]\)` denotes the set of regressors in matrix form. The residuals obtained from the null model are `$$\boldsymbol{e} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{R}_a\boldsymbol{V}),$$` where `\(\boldsymbol{R}_a=\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{X}_a(\boldsymbol{X}_a'\boldsymbol{X}_a)^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}_a'\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{V}\)` is a diagonal matrix with `\(V_{ii}=1+b(2-|a|)(X_i  -  a)^2\)`, `\(i = 1,...,n\)`. 

#### The **effect size** is derived as `\(ES = b\sqrt{n}\)`.

# `\(p\)`-value and Power Estimation for Multiple Selections

#### The assumptions about the **independence** still needed. Let `\(K\)` be the number of independent evaluations of a visual test, `\(s_i , i = 1, ..., K\)` be the **number of selections of the evaluations**, and `\(X\)` be the random variable denoting the number of detections. Then, the `\(p\)`-value of the visual test is given as: `$$P(X\geq x) = \sum_{j=x}^{K}Pr(j|s_1,...,s_K).$$`


#### The distribution of `\(X\)` given `\(s_1, ...s_K\)` can not be **derived trivially**, as it is a **sampling without replacement problem**. In practice, this distribution can be **approximated** by computer simulation.

---

# `\(p\)`-value and Power Estimation for Multiple Selections

#### Assume there is a **visual test** `\(V_K\)`, where `\(K\)` denoting the number of evaluations. The corresponding  `\(p\)`-value of `\(V_K\)` can be computed. 

#### Meanwhile, if one evaluation is **randomly deleted** from `\(V_K\)`, the remaining evaluations can still be used to form another valid visual test `\(V_{K-1}\)`. 

#### In fact, considering **all the possibilities**, `\(K\)` different outcomes for `\(V_{K-1}\)` can be obtained. 

#### Since all outcomes occur with **equal probability**, the **proportion of outcomes which reject the null hypothesis** can be used as an **estimator of the power of the visual test** `\(V_{K-1}\)`. 

#### Similarly, if we would like to estimate the power of the visual test `\(V_{K-j}\)` given the evaluations of `\(V_{K}\)`, for `\(j &lt; K\)`, we could find all the possible combinations of `\(K\)` elements, taken `\(k-j\)` at a time to obtain `\(K\choose{K-j}\)` different outcomes for `\(V_{K-j}\)`. Then, the estimated power is given as `\(R/{K\choose{K-j}}\)`, where `\(R\)` is the number of outcomes which reject the null hypothesis.

# Human Subject Experiment - Results


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

#### We collect **400** lineup evaluations made by **20** participants in experiment I and **880** lineup evaluations made by **44** participants in experiment II. In total, **442** unique lineups are evaluated by 64 subjects.

#### The power of each lineup from one to five evaluations is estimated.


#### The estimated power is further used in fitting **quasi-binomial generalized linear models** with natural logarithm of effect size as the only regressor.

#### Another method we use to model the power is to collect all decisions made by `\(K\choose{K-j}\)` different outcomes for `\(V_{K-j}\)`, and directly fit **binomial generalized linear models** with natural logarithm of effect size as the regressor.

#### We proposed an **automatic visual inference system** for evaluating lineups of residual plots, with a focus on the specification error of classical normal linear regression.

#### **Non-linearity** and **heteroskedasticity** are two features considered by the system so far. More features will be added to the system in the future however.

#### The system is built upon **computer vision models**.

&lt;!-- Modern computer vision model could be a promising solution to this problem. As a subfield of AI, computer vision with the modern deep learning architectures solved numerous critical problems in automation. Inspired by the vision processing in living organisms, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced by @fukushima_neocognitron_1982. Soon, this architecture was applied to hand-written number recognition trained with back-propagation by @lecun_backpropagation_1989. This was one of the earliest attempts which human successfully extract information from digital images via self-learning algorithms. Modern computer vision model is typically built on the deep neural network with convolutional layers [@fukushima_neocognitron_1982]. Convolutional layers take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and provide regularized versions of fully-connected layers. It downscales and transforms the image by summarising information in a small space. Numerous studies have shown that it can be used to effectively tackle vision tasks, such as image recognition [@rawat_deep_2017]. With the development of graphics processing units and the spread of high-performance personal computers, researches in computer vision become a new hype in the 21st century. Achievements such as computer-aided diagnosis [@lee_image_2015], pedestrian detection [@brunetti_computer_2018] and facial recognition [@emami_facial_2012] had a significant impact on our daily life. --&gt;




&lt;!-- The first project develops a prototype of automatic visual inference system for evaluating lineups of residual plots, with a focus on the classical normal linear regression model given it is one of the simplest predictive models. The automatic system is identical to the lineup protocol except evaluators are replaced by computer vision models. The computer vision models are trained by using data simulated from linear models with violations of different classical assumptions, such as linearity and homoscedasticity. Data of human performance on evaluating residual plots generated under the same simulation setting is collected by conducting online human subject experiments, such that the comparison between the power of human subject-assessed visual tests and the system-assessed visual tests can be made. Moreover, factors that affect the performance of the automatic system are studied for improving the architecture and design of the computer vision models. --&gt;
