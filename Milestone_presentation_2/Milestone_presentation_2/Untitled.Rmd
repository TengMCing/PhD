**Diagnostics** are the key to determining whether there is anything **importantly wrong** with a model.

**Residuals** summarise what is **not captured by the regression model**.

**Residual plots** are commonly used to diagnose **non-linearity** and **heteroskedasticity**. **Non-normality** is usually harder to detect from a residual plot. A favourable graphical summary for this task is the **quantile-quantile plot**.

Many different hypothesis tests are available to detect specific model defects.

Non-linearity: 
  - **F-test**
  - **RESET test** (Ramsey 1969)

Heteroskedasticity: 
  - **White test** (White 1980)
  - **BP test** (Breusch and Pagan 1979)

Non-normality: 
  - **SW test** (Shapiro and Wilk 1965)
  - **Jarque‚ÄìBera test** (Jarque and Bera 1980)

BP and SW tests reject the residual plots exhibiting structure that **they weren‚Äôt designed for** (**type III error**).

Most residual-based tests for particular types of departure are also sensitive to other types of departures (Cook and Weisberg 1982).

With **large sample sizes**, hypothesis tests may reject a residual plot when there is only a **slight departure** (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980). 

While such rejections may be **statistically correct**, their sensitivity may render the results **impractical**. 

**Minor defects** in the model are **unlikely** to have a **significant impact** and may be best disregarded for practical purposes. 

Therefore, a key goal of **residual plot diagnostics** is to **identify** potential issues that could lead to **incorrect conclusions or errors in subsequent analyses**.

### Plotting the data is the recommended method by experts for diagnosing model fits. 

- Draper and Smith (1998) and Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980):
> Residual plots are usually revealing when the assumptions are violated.

- Cook and Weisberg (1982):
> Formal tests and graphical procedures are complementary and both have a place in residual analysis, but graphical methods are easier to use.

- Montgomery and Peck (1982):
> Residual plots are more informative in most practical situations than the corresponding conventional hypothesis tests.
