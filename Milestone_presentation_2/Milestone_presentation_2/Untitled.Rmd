# Thesis structure (project structure)

Mention we will focus on the first chapter. (bold the chapter text)

---

# Regression diagnostics

Why we need to perform regression diagnostics?
Available methods.

---

# Reading residual plot vs. conventional statistical testing

(Use non-linearity as the example)

How people read residual plot?
How statistical testing detect residual departures?

---

# Visual inference

What is visual inference?

Underline that it is a valid inferential framework. Highlights the difference from reading a residual plot.

---

# Integrate visual tests into regression diagnostics

(Still use non-linearity as the example)

How to perform a visual test in the context of regression diagnostics. 

Show the $p$-value by assuming the responses.


---

# Limitations of visual inference

Discuss the limitations of visual inference.

---

# Computer vision models

Briefly mention the potential solution to the problem.
