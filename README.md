# PhD

## /*_experiment
The *_experiment folder contains the scripts to setup the experiments along with the collected data. However, the collected data is pretty raw and it is not recommended to be used directly. Instead, user should check the `vi_survey` object and the `get_vi_lineup()` function from the `visage` package (`remotes::install_github("TengMCing/visage")`). Those two objects contain the cleaned dataset and the data used to produce lineups.

## Milestone_1 and Milestone_presentation_1

These two folders contain the materials submitted or presented in the first milestone of the PhD.

## Thesis

This is not an up-to-date folder. It contains files which will be submitted at the end of the PhD.

## Other folders

These folders are previously used but were deprecated a long time ago. They might be useful in the future.
