Monash PhD Thesis Rmarkdown Template
========================

This repository provides a template for a Monash University PhD thesis using Rmarkdown with the bookdown package. It is designed for PhD students in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, but can be modified for Masters degrees, other departments and other universities as required.

## Requirements

To set up the software, you will need to install the `bookdown` package and its dependencies as follows:

```r
install.packages('bookdown')
```

You will also need LaTeX installed. If you don't already have LaTeX, one convenient approach is to install it via R:

```r
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
