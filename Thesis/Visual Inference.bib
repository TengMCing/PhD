	abstract = {This article presents individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data-generating model. Through simulated examples and real datasets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

	title = {Detecting distributional differences between temporal granularities for exploratory time series analysis},
	abstract = {Cyclic temporal granularities are temporal deconstructions of a time period into units such as hour-of-theday and work-day/weekend. They can be useful for measuring repetitive patterns in large univariate time series data, and feed new approaches to exploring time series data. One use is to take pairs of granularities, and make plots of response values across the categories induced by the temporal deconstruction. However, when there are many granularities that can be constructed for a time period, there will also be too many possible displays to decide which might be the more interesting to display. This work proposes a new distance metric to screen and rank the possible granularities, and hence choose the most interesting ones to plot. The distance measure is computed for a single or pairs of cyclic granularities and can be compared across different cyclic granularities or on a collection of time series. The methods are implemented in the open-source R package hakear.},

	abstract = {Forensic examination of evidence like firearms and toolmarks, traditionally involves a visual and therefore subjective assessment of similarity of two questioned items. Statistical models are used to overcome this subjectivity and allow specification of error rates. These models are generally quite complex and produce abstract results at different levels of the analysis. Presenting such metrics and complicated results to examiners is challenging, as examiners generally do not have substantial statistical training to accurately interpret results. This creates distrust in statistical modelling and lowers the rate of acceptance of more objective measures that the discipline at large is striving for. We present an inferential framework for assessing the model and its output. The framework is designed to calibrate trust in forensic experts by bridging the gap between domain specific knowledge and predictive model results, allowing forensic examiners to validate the claims of the predictive model while critically assessing results.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread use of graphs in empirical research, little is known about readers' ability to process the statistical information they are meant to convey ("visual inference"). We study visual inference within the context of regression discontinuity (RD) designs by measuring how accurately readers identify discontinuities in graphs produced from data generating processes calibrated on 11 published papers from leading economics journals. First, we assess the effects of different graphical representation methods on visual inference using randomized experiments. We find that bin widths and fit lines have the largest impacts on whether participants correctly perceive the presence or absence of a discontinuity. Incorporating the experimental results into two decision theoretical criteria adapted from the recent economics literature, we find that using small bins with no fit lines to construct RD graphs performs well and recommend it as a starting point to practitioners. Second, we compare visual inference with widely used econometric inference procedures. We find that visual inference achieves similar or lower type I error rates and complements econometric inference.},

	abstract = {In football research, ‘small’ trials with low statistical power are common. On the elite level, the inherently low number of participants obviously conflicts with the relevance of even tiny effects. However, general characteristics of football also contribute (e.g. multifactorially influenced and/or complex outcomes). Importantly, small sample sizes are problematic regardless of the study outcome with issues ranging from inconclusive results and low precision to unrepeatable ‘discoveries’ and overestimation of effect sizes. Therefore, meeting the calculated, target sample size is the first priority. If a suboptimal sample size must be accepted, a range of tools can improve insights. To begin with, some general aspects of data collection and analysis become more important and should be optimally implemented (e.g. reliability of measures). Building on this foundation, specific amendments are available on the levels of data collection (e.g. aggregated single-subject designs) and data analysis (e.g. Bayesian methods). The present commentary aims to give an overview of selected, practical tools for dealing with small sample sizes in football research and provide recommendations for their application in scenarios typical for the field. Importantly, versatility and adaptability are mirrored by the need for utmost transparency including a predetermined (ideally preregistered) study plan. Collaboration or counselling with an expert statistician is strongly encouraged.},

But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently “model free” and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems might enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference can be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},

In simulation studies [12] lineups have been shown as being efficient: the power of visual tests is comparable to classical tests while being much less stringent in terms of distributional assumptions made. This makes lineups versatile, yet powerful, tools in situations where conditions for regular statistical tests are not or cannot be met. In this paper we introduce lineups as a tool for evaluating the power of competing graphical designs. We highlight some of the theoretical properties and then show results from two studies evaluating competing designs: both studies are designed to go to the limits of our perceptual abilities to highlight differences between designs. We use both accuracy and speed of evaluation as measures of a successful design. The first study compares the choice of coordinate system: polar versus cartesian coordinates. The results show strong support in favor of cartesian coordinates in finding fast and accurate answers to spotting patterns. The second study is aimed at finding shift differences between distributions. Both studies are motivated by data problems that we have recently encountered, and explore using simulated data to evaluate the plot designs under controlled conditions. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is used to conduct the studies. The lineups provide an effective mechanism for objectively evaluating plot designs.},

Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical principles.We present here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphic designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods.

	abstract = {Statistical graphics play a crucial role in exploratory data analysis, model checking, and diagnosis. The lineup protocol enables statistical significance testing of visual findings, bridging the gulf between exploratory and inferential statistics. In this article, inferential methods for statistical graphics are developed further by refining the terminology of visual inference and framing the lineup protocol in a context that allows direct comparison with conventional tests in scenarios when a conventional test exists. This framework is used to compare the performance of the lineup protocol against conventional statistical testing in the scenario of fitting linear models. A human subjects experiment is conducted using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that the lineup protocol performs comparably with the conventional tests, and expectedly outperforms them when data are contaminated, a scenario where assumptions required for performing a conventional test are violated. Surprisingly, visual tests have higher power than the conventional tests when the effect size is large. And, interestingly, there may be some super-visual individuals who yield better performance and power than the conventional test even in the most difficult tasks.

	abstract = {Hierarchical structures are omnipresent in today's society—this is reflected in the data that we collect on all aspects of this society. Hierarchical linear models allow a representation of structural levels in a statistical modeling framework. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the quality of model estimation and explore features of the data not well described by the model. Residual and influence diagnostics are familiar tools for the classical regression model with independent observations. For hierarchical linear models, these diagnostic tools must be adjusted to reflect the dependence introduced by the nested data structure. Residual analysis now includes the assessment of distributional assumptions at each level of the model. This requires the use of level-dependent residual quantities. Similarly, the parameter estimates may be influenced at each level of the model, requiring influence diagnostics that can pinpoint specific levels of the model, as well as specific aspects of the model. We present an overview of the diagnostic tools available for hierarchical linear models that are familiar from linear models. Additionally, we discuss the utility of the lineup protocol for residual analysis with complex models.

	abstract = {Visual statistical inference is a way to determine significance of patterns found while exploring data. It is dependent on the evaluation of a lineup, of a data plot among a sample of null plots, by human observers. Each individual is different in their cognitive psychology and judiciousness, which can affect the visual inference. The usual way to estimate the effectiveness of a statistical test is its power. The estimate of power of a lineup can be controlled by combining evaluations from multiple observers. Factors that may also affect the power of visual inference are the observers' demographics, visual skills, and experience, the sample of null plots taken from the null distribution, the position of the data plot in the lineup, and the signal strength in the data. This paper examines these factors. Results from multiple visual inference studies using Amazon's Mechanical Turk are examined to provide an assessment of these. The experiments suggest that individual skills vary substantially, but demographics do not have a huge effect on performance. There is evidence that a learning effect exists but only in that observers get faster with repeated evaluations, but not more often correct. The placement of data plot in the lineup does not affect the inference.},

	abstract = {Graphics play a crucial role in statistical analysis and data mining. This paper describes metrics developed to assist the use of lineups for making inferential statements. Lineups embed the plot of the data among a set of null plots, and engage a human observer to select the plot that is most different from the rest. If the data plot is selected it corresponds to the rejection of a null hypothesis. Metrics are calculated in association with lineups, to measure the quality of the lineup, and help to understand what people see in the data plots. The null plots represent a finite sample from a null distribution, and the selected sample potentially affects the ease or difficulty of a lineup. Distance metrics are designed to describe how close the true data plot is to the null plots, and how close the null plots are to each other. The distribution of the distance metrics is studied to learn how well this matches to what people detect in the plots, the effect of null generating mechanism and plot choices for particular tasks. The analysis was conducted on data that has already been collected from Amazon Turk studies conducted with lineups for studying an array of data analysis tasks.},

Instead, HOPs enables viewers to infer properties of the distribution using mental processes like counting and integration. We conducted an experiment comparing HOPs to error bars and violin plots.

However, there are costs associated with multimodel inferences, so they are not always appropriate or desirable. First, we present statistical inference in the big picture of data analysis and the deductive–inductive process of scientific discovery. Inferences on fixed states of nature, such as survey sampling methods, generally use a single model. Multimodel inferences are used primarily when modeling processes of nature, when there is no hope of knowing the true model. However, even in these cases, iterating on a single model may meet objectives without introducing additional complexity. Additionally, discovering new features in the data through model diagnostics is easier when considering a single model. There are costs for multimodel inferences, including the coding, computing, and summarization time on each model. When cost is included, a reasonable strategy may often be iterating on a single model. We recommend that researchers and managers carefully examine objectives and cost when considering multimodel inference methods. Published 2015.

	abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

We use extended FCA first by allowing K-valued entries in the incidence to accommodate other, non-binary types of data, and second with different modes of creating formal concepts to accommodate diverse conceptualizing phenomena. With these extensions we demonstrate the versatility of the Landscapes of Knowledge metaphor to help in creating new scientific and engineering knowledge by providing several successful use cases of our techniques that support scientific hypothesis-making and discovery in a range of domains: semiring theory, perceptual studies, natural language semantics, and gene expression data analysis. While doing so, we also capture the affordances that justify the use of FCA and its extensions in scientific discovery.},

Our solution enables tablets, smartphones or laptops to be used as interaction units for manipulating, organising, and querying data. We highlight the modularity of encube, allowing additional functionalities to be included as required. Additionally, our approach supports a high level of collaboration within the physical environment. We show how our implementation of encube operates in a large-scale, hybrid visualisation and supercomputing environment using the CAVE2 at Monash University, and on a local desktop, making it a versatile solution.

Second, visualization principles for constructing tables are provided, and a practical example of remaking a poor table using these guidelines is shown. Finally, the utility of using time series charts to easily identify short- and long-term increases, as well as outliers in seasonal data using examples with actual crime data is illustrated.},

This apparent subjectivity is unnecessary. By drawing on the computational and display facilities now widely available, qqplots are easily enriched to help with their interpretation. An overview of quantile functions and quantile–quantile plots is presented against the backdrop of their early historical development. Strengths and shortcomings of the traditional display are described. A new enhanced qqplot, the self-calibrating qqplot, is introduced and demonstrated on a variety of examples—both synthetic and real. Real examples include normal qqplots, log-normal plots, half-normal plots for factorial experiments, qqplots for and s in process improvement applications, detection of multivariate outliers, and the comparison of empirical distributions. Self-calibration is had by visually incorporating sampling variation in the qqplot display in a variety of ways.

The core idea is to generate sample datasets from a null hypothesis to visually compare with the actual dataset. The comparison is performed from a line-up of graphs where a single graph of the actual data is hidden among multiple graphs of sample data. If the real data is discernible, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Here, we illustrate the utility of graphical inference using examples from climatology, biogeography, and health geography. The examples include inferences about location of the mean, change across space and time, and clustering. We show that graphical inference is a useful technique to answer a broad range of common questions in geographical datasets. This approach is needed to avoid the common pitfalls of “straw man” hypotheses and “p-hacking” as datasets become increasingly larger and more complex.},

In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ‘discoveries’ is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the ‘lineup’ popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the ‘Rorschach’ inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students’ statistical thinking.},

	abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

	abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception—the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs—and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms—dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

	abstract = {The number of online experiments conducted with subjects recruited via online platforms has grown considerably in the recent past. While one commercial crowdworking platform – Amazon’s Mechanical Turk – basically has established and since dominated this field, new alternatives offer services explicitly targeted at researchers. In this article, we present www.prolific.ac and lay out its suitability for recruiting subjects for social and economic science experiments. After briefly discussing key advantages and challenges of online experiments relative to lab experiments, we trace the platform’s historical development, present its features, and contrast them with requirements for different types of social and economic experiments.},
