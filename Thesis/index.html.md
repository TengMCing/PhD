I would like to thank my pet goldfish for ...

> In accordance with Chapter 7.1.4 of the research degrees handbook, if you have engaged the services of a professional editor, you must provide their name and a brief description of the service rendered. If the professional editor's current or former area of academic specialisation is similar your own, this too should be stated as it may suggest to examiners that the editor's advice to the student has extended beyond guidance on English expression to affect the substance and structure of the thesis.

Your acknowledgement should at a minimum specify which technology was used, include explicit description on how the information was generated, and explain how the output was used in your work. Below is a suggested format:

> “I acknowledge the use of [insert AI system(s) and link] to [specific use of generative artificial intelligence]. The output from these was used to [explain use].”

> > “This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.”
