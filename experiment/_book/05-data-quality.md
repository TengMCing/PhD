# (PART\*) Analysis of the experiment data {-}

# Data quality

The quality of the experiment data mainly depends on the respondent engagement. We could measure this by several variables:

1. response time
2. number of selections
3. Correction rate


Identifications for potential low quality responses:

  a. fail to identify an easy lineup because of little response time is a potential low quality response
  b. spend too little time in the study
